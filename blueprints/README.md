## `blueprints` - Folder containing Flask 'blueprints'
This folder contains Flask 'blueprints' that are sort of 'routers' that route a request to the correct handler function (that might not be in this but another package (like `api/`)).

This helps organize everything a bit better and keep things like API and render logic separate.
