## `pages` - Folder containing all templates
This folder contains all HTML templates that are needed to put together the UI of the web dashboard and display software. It's grouped into the base template of a page (which is in this folder), separate, re-usable components (`components/`) which are essentially 'partials' of the page and content (`content`).
